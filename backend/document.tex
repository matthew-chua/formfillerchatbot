\textbf{write a short paragraph on what you hope to gain from your exchange with the US?}

I am looking forward to gaining a broad perspective on global cultures and an in-depth understanding of the American way of life. This exchange offers a unique opportunity to immerse myself in the educational and social fabric of the US, allowing me to acquire new knowledge, skills, and friendships that I believe will be invaluable in my personal and professional growth.
